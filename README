# Ingress Portal Key Manager

## (The Rough Beta)

This is based on Tha.Suresh's gmaps sample project because (as we all know) I'm still learning rails and this was the best way to start.

The concept is really simple - once it's finished it will be a way to allow users to store their portal keys and SEE THEM ON A GOOGLE MAP!  This allows for planning of raids, inventory control, etc.

To do:
	Users
	Google Login Handling
	Styling
	(etc)
	
Any suggestions?  Fork it and let your voice be heard!
